    <h2>Chapel Hill Transit Ridership Recovery Post COVID-19</h2>
    GEOG-456 Final Project - Suzanne Tyler <br> 
    
    Data for this project was provided by <a href = "https://www.townofchapelhill.org/Home/Components/StaffDirectory/StaffDirectory/1300/703?sortn=STitle&alpha=D&sortd=asc">Carolina Dwyer</a>, Planning Manager for Chapel Hill Transit. 

    <h3>Introduction and Motivation</h3>
    Public transportation was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and <a href = "https://www.axios.com/2023/12/14/public-trasnportation-transit-america-recovery-pandemic-covid">in many areas has failed to bounce back</a> to pre-pandemic levels. Chapel Hill Transit has yet to return to pre-pandemic employee numbers or route frequency. In this project, I have attempted to visualize the impact of COVID on bus ridership in Chapel Hill in order to analyze the continued impacts of the pandemic, and pinpoint where ridership remains low.<br>

    <h3>Initial Impact of COVID-19 on Chapel Hill Transit</h3>

    Between January 2020 and April 2020, 445 out of 583 operating bus stops in Chapel Hill were closed, leaving 138 open.<br><br>

    Ridership dropped by over 99% percent, from almost 45,000 average daily riders in January 2020 to less than 300 in April. Over 80% of all stops from Janurary 2020 saw a 100% decrease in ridersip. <br><br>

    382 stops were reopened by January 2021, and by January 2022 over 500 were back in service. Ridership, however, has been much slower to recover. <br>
