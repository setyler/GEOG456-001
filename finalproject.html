    <h2>Chapel Hill Transit Ridership Recovery Post COVID-19</h2>
    GEOG-456 Final Project - Suzanne Tyler <br> 
    
    Data for this project was provided by <a href = "https://www.townofchapelhill.org/Home/Components/StaffDirectory/StaffDirectory/1300/703?sortn=STitle&alpha=D&sortd=asc">Carolina Dwyer</a>, Planning Manager for Chapel Hill Transit. 

    <h3>Introduction and Motivation</h3>
    Public transportation was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and in many areas has failed to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels. Chapel Hill Transit has yet to return to pre-pandemic employee numbers or route frequency. In this project, I have attempted to visualize the impact of COVID on bus ridership in Chapel Hill in order to analyze the continued impacts of the pandemic, and pinpoint where ridership remains low. 

    <h3>Initial Impact of COVID-19 on Chapel Hill Transit</h3>

    Between January 2019 and April 2019, 445 out of 583 operating bus stops in Chapel Hill were closed.

    goals for this section: 
    maps showing comparison between 2019 and 2020 data sets 

    if arcgis pro: 
    (1) side-by-side maps of in service stops, dec 2019 vs april 2020 
    (2) side-by-side maps of ridership density proportional symbol maps (OVERLAPPING PROP SYMBOLS)
    (3) slider ? or maybe some types of graphs or something 

    <h3>Ridership Recovery from 2021 - 2024</h3>
